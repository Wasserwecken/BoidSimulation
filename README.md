# Boid simulation
![Image of simulation](/gitMedia/boids.png)

This branch was used to teach students in a workshop how boids are working.
This simulation uses unity physics to determine its neighbours and a clear, not optimized, code style for the simulation rules for good readablility and understanding.

## Requirements
- Unity 2019.3

## Simulation rules
- Seperation
- Alignment
- Cohesion
- Target point
