# Boid simulation
![Image of simulation](/.doc/boids.png)

This branch was used to teach students in a workshop how boids are working.
This simulation uses unity physics to determine its neighbors and a clear, not optimized, code style for the simulation rules for good readability and understanding.

## Simulation rules
- Separation
- Alignment
- Cohesion
- Target point
